Bridge Foundry is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion or prior experience. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from an event or virtual forum at the discretion of the organizers. 

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, native language, or operating system. Harassment also includes sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Organizers will often seek first to educate the individuals, especially for newcomers. However, if a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate  including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer immediately. 

Organizers will identify themselves during the opening remarks of every event.  If you are unsure of who to contact, ask any volunteer (usually identified with a star on their nametag).
