# Bridge Foundry Code of Conduct -- DRAFT

Bridge Foundry seeks to create a community of software developers that are reflective of the diversity in the general population. To that end, we are dedicated to creating welcoming and friendly learning environments.  

The following organizations are Bridge Foundry projects or partners and agree to the code of conduct below:
* RailsBridge

All participants agree to the following:
* Everyone has something to contribute. Everyone deserves access to materials and community that will help them learn. As long as an individual can be respectful and not disruptive to other participants, they deserve to participate.
* If there is limited space and resources, anyone is welcome to replicate an event, such that more opportunities may be available. All curricula and organizing materials are open source and free. Provided that the organizer and event conform to project guidelines, we will help.
* A harassment-free experience for everyone is essential. Our anti-harassment policy can be found at: [insert URL here]

Furthermore, workshops and associated "after party" must be safe environments focused on learning.  

## Clear examples of how to comply with the Code of Conduct
* Use your words. If you feel like it would help to work directly on someone's keyboard, ask first. 
* Refer participants to open and free material for follow-up learning.   
* Do not ask anyone out on a date. 
* Remember that "No, Thanks" means "No". Respect that and don't be pushy. If they want to follow your recommendation, they will. 

## Gray Area
If you are not sure if something is appropriate behavior, it probably isn't.  Each person gets to define for himself or herself where that line is.  There are cultural difference and age differences. Impact matters more than intent.  If you didnâ€™t realize that your behavior would have a negative impact, that is your responsibility.  Problems happen when we presume that our way of being is ok with everyone, when we assume that our way of thinking or behaving is the norm.  This is particularly problematic when the other person is less empowered or is a member of a minority group.

* If you are a teacher or volunteer for their email address or phone number, it may be interpreted as creepy or stalking OR it may be a friendly follow-up.  Be aware that you may not detect the difference.  If you just met the other person for the first time, consider offering your contact info, instead of requesting theirs.
